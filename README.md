# Three Body Problem Simulator

An interactive 3D visualization of the three-body problem using Three.js. This simulator allows users to explore the chaotic and unpredictable behavior of a gravitational system with three bodies.

## Features

- Real-time 3D simulation of gravitational interactions
- Interactive controls to adjust mass, velocity, and initial positions
- Camera controls for exploring the simulation from any angle
- Cinematic mode for dynamic viewing
- Mobile-responsive design with touch support
- Ability to adjust bodies during simulation

## Technologies

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- HTML5 and CSS3
- JavaScript ES6
- Responsive design for various device sizes

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Use the control panels to adjust simulation parameter
3. Try starting with the default parameters for a stable orbit,then make a small change while the bodies are moving. Speed up time for a chaotic dance
4. Click the "Toggle Borderless" button for more space to play
4. Toggle UI visibility with the "Hide UI" button
5. Enable "Cinematic Mode" for dynamic viewing and camera cuts

## Controls

- **Mass Controls**: Adjust the mass of each body
- **Velocity Controls**: Adjust the velocity of each body
- **Position Controls**: Adjust the positions of each body
- **Camera Controls**: Rotate, and zoom to explore the simulation
- **Preset Camera Views**: Choose from several preset viewpoints
- **Speed Controls**: Adjust simulation speed and time step
- **Reset**: Return to initial conditions or preset configurations

## Development
